# Data Preparation

No structural errors were found (coding errors, trailing blanks in labels, lower/upper case consistency, etc.).

Data types were propperly adapted to categorial when required (using the `as.factor` function).

Additionally, a new derived column was created from `tenure`.

```{r}
head(customer_churn)

str(customer_churn)

summary(customer_churn)


customer_churn$gender <- as.factor(customer_churn$gender)
customer_churn$SeniorCitizen <- as.factor(
  customer_churn$SeniorCitizen,
  levels = c("No", "Yes")
)
customer_churn$Partner <- as.factor(customer_churn$Partner)
customer_churn$Dependents <- as.factor(customer_churn$Dependents)
customer_churn$PhoneService <- as.factor(customer_churn$PhoneService)
customer_churn$MultipleLines <- as.factor(customer_churn$MultipleLines)
customer_churn$InternetService <- as.factor(customer_churn$InternetService)
customer_churn$OnlineSecurity <- as.factor(customer_churn$OnlineSecurity)
customer_churn$OnlineBackup <- as.factor(customer_churn$OnlineBackup)
customer_churn$DeviceProtection <- as.factor(customer_churn$DeviceProtection)
customer_churn$TechSupport <- as.factor(customer_churn$TechSupport)
customer_churn$StreamingTV <- as.factor(customer_churn$StreamingTV)
customer_churn$StreamingMovies <- as.factor(customer_churn$StreamingMovies)
customer_churn$Contract <- as.factor(customer_churn$Contract)
customer_churn$PaperlessBilling <- as.factor(customer_churn$PaperlessBilling)
customer_churn$PaymentMethod <- as.factor(customer_churn$PaymentMethod)
customer_churn$Churn <- as.factor(customer_churn$Churn)

customer_churn$TenureGroup <- cut(
  customer_churn$tenure,
  breaks = c(0, 9, 29, 55, 73),
  labels = c("Very short", "Short", "Long", "Very long"),
  include.lowest = TRUE
)
